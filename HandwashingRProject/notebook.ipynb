If Dr. Semmelweis looks troubled it's probably because he's thinking about <em>childbed fever</em>: A deadly disease affecting women that just have given birth. He is thinking about it because in the early 1840s at the Vienna General Hospital as many as 10% of the women giving birth die from it. He is thinking about it because he knows the cause of childbed fever: It's the contaminated hands of the doctors delivering the babies. And they won't listen to him and <em>wash their hands</em>!</p>\n<p>In this notebook, we're going to reanalyze the data that made Semmelweis discover the importance of <em>handwashing</em>. Let's start by looking at the data that made Semmelweis realize that something was wrong with the procedures at Vienna General Hospital.</p>"},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load in the tidyverse package\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Read datasets/yearly_deaths_by_clinic.csv into yearly\nyearly <- read_csv(\"datasets/yearly_deaths_by_clinic.csv\")\n\n# Print out yearly\nyearly","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"45ea098e15"},"deletable":false,"editable":false,"run_control":{"frozen":true},"tags":["context"]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.
